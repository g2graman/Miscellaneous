The implementation for a XOR doubly linked list is not included in this repository since the manipulation of 'pointers' in python cannot be implemented efficiently. Specifically, though we can find the address of a variable with built-in id(), there is no built-in inverse which runs in constant time so finding the variable at an arbitrary address (which would be necessary for the XOR doubly linked list) would have to be done by iterating through globals() until the variable with the matching address is found.
