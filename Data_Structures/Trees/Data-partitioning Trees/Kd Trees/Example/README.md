images.py
=========

Contains a primitive example for converting an image (with the help of the
PyGraphics "media" module, which is required to run it) into five-dimensional
tuples which hold r, g, b, x, y values for each pixel. The tuples are used to
populate an Implicit (max) KD Tree and the leaves of that tree are printed to
the screen.
