Windows Scripts
===============

All the folders in this directory contain registry keys for the Windows Registry editor that will create new entries in the context menu which call Python scripts. For this reason, Python is required.

Contents:
- Pathname (for finding the absolute path of files or directories)
- Order (for ordering the contents of a directory)
